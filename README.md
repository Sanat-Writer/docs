At the Home Page of the Backend Website, the user can see many options like Analytics, Executive Dashboards, Organizations, Pickleball Inc., PPA, Team Leagues, Tournament and, Users.
Out of these, we will focus only on the 'Organizations' and will get a detailed info out of it.

## Organization

Jumping onto the Organization option, if the User is a part of more than one organization or, if he handles more than one Organization, then he can do it from this page. On this page, the user can see many different options where one of the option is to 'Add a new Organization' on the top right corner of this page. The User does not have the authority to add a new organization. The user has to provide certain specifications of his new organization to the internal/support team in our Organization for review to avoid duplicacy in the organization's name and other factors. The support team has the authority to edit/add the organization. After everything is cleared, the internal team will add a new organization for the User.
There are a few other options and dropdown lists on this page which includes the Organization's Logo, Title, Type, Actions, etc.
